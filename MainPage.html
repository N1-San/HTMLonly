                    <p>The above 3 images have no specific purpose than to take up space to make this website look more filled. This was not originally the plan when i was making the design for the website on my notebook, i changed it because the previous design required a lot of css and i want this to be an HTML only website, hence the name of the website.</p>
                    <p>p.s. i made those picttures myself using reference images ofcourse, but yes those are mine.</p>

                    <p>Yes i made the design for this webiste on my notebook before making it. Check my github for images of the notebook.</p>
